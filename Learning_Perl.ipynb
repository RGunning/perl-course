      "Perl is widely used by biologists to solve problems we encounter when handling DNA and protein sequences, file format conversions, as well as many any other tasks that are computationally repetitive. Perl is not the only language for these tasks but one of many. \n",

      "Perl comes preinstalled on Macs and Linux distributions. It can be downloaded for PCs (see [perl.org](http://www.perl.org/get.html#win32) for details; [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com) is a good choice). \n",

Perl's motto is [\"There's More Than One Way To Do It\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it). This has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, Perl can be easily adopted by many different communities and applied to many different problems; it is heavily used by organisations like the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/perl.shtml) and [Amazon](http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture) and was instrumental in the completion of the [Human Genome Project](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/How_Perl_saved_human_genome).

As computers do not understand Perl directly, our scripts must be processed by a program called the Perl interpreter, which translates the scripts into machine language. This program is run from the command line. To get started with Perl, we must get acquainted with the command line.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. If there is an error in your code that the interpreter can't make sense of, it will fail to run. But it can also warn you about problems in the code that it can interpret, but which are probably not going to work correctly. You can turn on these warnings by putting this at the top of your script:\n",

      "\n",
      "    `use warnings` and `-w` do the same thing, so you only need to use one of them.\n",
      "2. It's useful to annotate your scripts with human-readable comments. Perl ignores anything on a line that follows a hash symbol. So we could have written:\n",
      "    - `# central_dogma.pl`\n",
      "    - `# Print the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology`\n",
      "    - `print \"Once information has passed into protein it cannot get out again\\n\" # See Crick 1970`\n",
      "\n",
      "    In this case, the comments are not very useful, but when we get to writing more complicated code it is very useful to make notes in comments, to remind ourselves how the code works when we come to read it months or years later.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Many Perl guides will tell you to add `use strict;` to every script you write (like `use warnings;` above). This tells the Perl interpreter to complain if you use some of the more dangerous Perl idioms in your code. It's not too important for the course, as we won't be using any of those idioms, but it's not a bad idea to use it in scripts you write and actually use."

But the brackets on the `int` line arguably clutter up the line rather than making it clearer. Sometimes the brackets will be necessary, however, to tell Perl which arguments belong to which function. As `int` only takes one argument, there is no ambiguity here, but we will shortly see some examples where the brackets are required. This is something you will figure out through experience."

But we might want to pass in several data structures as input and return more than one value, or possibly more than one complex data structure. We know from looking at arrays earlier that if we put an array inside of an array, Perl will flatten the array and lose the internal structure. This will also happen if we pass in an array or a hash to a subroutine, which is no good.\n",

A reference is a Perl variable that refers to the memory address of some other variable.

References are scalars, so we can use them to pass complex data structures into subroutines, by passing in references to these data structures. Similarly, to create an array of arrays, we create an array of references to other arrays.\n",
